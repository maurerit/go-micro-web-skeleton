go-micro-web-skeleton
=====================

Built to handle the packaging of an angular-cli application and serve it up inside a go-micro landscape

Simply fork this repo, build your js artifacts into the js folder and your index.html into the root and `go build`.  The resulting binary will be suitable for serving up these assets behind the micro web executable.
